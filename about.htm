                  <h3 class="h5">IN SILICO STUDIES OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS OF AZADIRACHTA INDICA ON PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 AS A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR SNAKEBITE TREATMENT</h3>
                  <div class="research_abstract" style="height: 300px; overflow: hidden;">
                    <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
                    <p>Snakebites represent a significant global health issue, particularly in regions with a high incidence of venomous snake species. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes found in snake venoms play a crucial role in envenomation by disrupting cell membranes and causing tissue damage. Developing effective treatments for snakebites is a priority, and natural products have long been explored as potential sources of antidotes. Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, is a tree with a rich history in traditional medicine, known for its diverse array of bioactive compounds. This thesis investigates the insilico interactions between bioactive compounds from Azadirachta indica and Phospholipase A2 enzymes from various snake species, with the aim of identifying potential inhibitors for snakebite treatment.</p>
                  <p>The research employs computational tools and molecular docking simulations to explore the binding affinities and interaction mechanisms of Azadirachta indica compounds with PLA2 enzymes. A comprehensive database of bioactive compounds from neem is curated, and their structural properties are analyzed to predict their potential as PLA2 inhibitors. 
                    The findings of this study contribute to the growing body of research on snakebite treatment, offering insights into the potential use of natural compounds from Azadirachta indica as PLA2 inhibitors. By identifying compounds with promising binding affinities and interactions, this research paves the way for further experimental validation and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for snakebite management. Ultimately, this thesis highlights the importance of harnessing computational methods to expedite drug discovery processes and addresses a critical need for effective snakebite treatments in regions afflicted by venomous snake populations.

                  <div class="research_abstract" style="height: 300px; overflow: hidden;">
                    <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
                    <p>Transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in molecular biology by controlling the transcription of genetic information into messenger RNA through specific DNA binding. Homeobox genes, categorized into various groups, are vital for the regulation of morphogenesis and cell differentiation. SHOX2 (short stature homeobox 2), a member of the PRD class of homeobox genes, has been extensively characterized as a transcriptional regulator involved in pattern formation in invertebrates and vertebrates. Notably, SHOX2 is crucial for the expression of sonic hedgehog (shh) in dorsal-residing Purkinje cells and is essential for normal cerebellar development. The complex embryonic expression pattern of SHOX2 suggests its involvement in craniofacial, limb, brain, and heart development.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the years, various laboratories and researchers have made predictions and proposals regarding the brain enhancers of SHOX2. However, there has been a lack of a systematic approach to consolidate these critical enhancers, and statistical records of yearly discoveries remain challenging. In this study, we aim to address this gap by compiling all known brain enhancers of SHOX2, utilizing the VISTA Enhancers Browser (VEB) and Published Data (PD). Our objective is to facilitate research efforts, reduce costs, and minimize labor-intensive processes related to SHOX2 enhancer studies. By providing a comprehensive compilation, we hope to enhance our understanding of the role of SHOX2 in brain development and related processes.</p>
